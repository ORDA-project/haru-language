September,"earth, Wind & Fire",https://youtu.be/Gs069dndIYk?si=XFji0B0iNEAYrwrU,"Do you remember
The 21st night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away, oh, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya, dancin' in September
Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day
Ba-du-da, ba-du-da, ba-du-da, ba-du
Ba-du-da, ba-du, ba-du-da, ba-du
Ba-du-da, ba-du, ba-du-da
My thoughts are with you
Holdin' hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love, remember
How we knew love was here to stay
Now December
Found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love, remember
The true love we share today
Hey, hey, hey
Ba-dee-ya, say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya, dancin' in September
Ba-dee-ya, never was a cloudy day
There was a
Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), dancin' in September
Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), golden dreams were shiny days
The bell was ringin', oh, oh
Our souls were singin'
Do you remember never a cloudy day? Yow
There was a
Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), dancin' in September
Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), never was a cloudy day
And we'll say
Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), say, do you remember?
Ba-dee-ya (dee-ya, dee-ya), dancin' in September
Ba-dee-ya (dee ya, dee-ya), golden dreams were shiny days
Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya!
Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya
Ba-dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya, dee-ya!"
home sweet home,Motley crue,https://youtu.be/m1P6Xtb3dU4?si=0atahZdRn_i8BAhK,"You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
It doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song
And you'll never feel left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this long and winding road
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
You know that I've seen
Too many romantic dreams
Up in lights, falling off the silver screen
My heart's like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometime nothing keeps me together at the seams
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Home sweet home
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Yeah, I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home"
eye in the sky,The Alan Parsons Project,https://youtu.be/56hqrlQxMMI?si=Oh_XfNJjqpyLLLoo,"Don't think sorry's easily said
Don't try turning tables instead
You've taken lots of Chances before
But I'm not gonna give anymore
Don't ask me
That's how it goes
Cause part of me knows what you're thinkin'
Don't say words you're gonna regret
Don't let the fire rush to your head
I've heard the accusation before
And I ain't gonna take any more
Believe me
The sun in your Eyes
Made some of the lies worth believing
Chorus:
I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see any more
To know that
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
Don't leave false illusions behind
Don't Cry cause I ain't chnaging my mind
So find another fool like before
Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing
Some of the lies while all of the Signs are deceiving"
every breath you take,The Police,https://youtu.be/OMOGaugKpzs?si=5TvHFJTMyPJuavx3,"Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take
I'll be watchin' you
Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay
I'll be watchin' you
Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take
Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
I'll be watchin' you
Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep cryin', ""Baby, baby, please""
Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take
Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake

everybody wants to the rule the world,Tears For Fears,https://youtu.be/aGCdLKXNF3w?si=jqLeo1ay8c6brt1W,"Welcome to your life.
There's no turning back.
Even while we sleep.
We will find you
Acting out your best behavior
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody Wants to Rule the World.
It's my own desire
It's my own reward.
Help me to decide
Help me make the most of freedom
And our pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever.
Everybody Wants to Rule the World.
There's a room where the light won't find you,
Holding hands while The Walls come tumbling down.
When they do, I'll be right behind you.
So glad, we've almost made it;
So sad, they had to take it.
Everybody Wants to Rule the World."

Englishman In New York,sting,https://youtu.be/D_WH3I17c5A?si=41DHuRVFWFD7nm7E,"I don't drink coffee, I take tea, my dear
I like my toast done on one side
And you can hear it in my accent when I talk
I'm an Englishman in New York
See me walking down Fifth Avenue
A walking cane here at my side
I take it everywhere I walk
I'm an Englishman in New York
Oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York
Oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York
If ""manners maketh man"" as someone said
He's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself no matter what they say
Oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York
Oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York
Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety
You could end up as the only one
Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
At night a candle's brighter than the sun
Takes more than combat gear to make a man
Takes more than a license for a gun
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
A gentleman will walk but never run
If ""manners maketh man"" as someone said
He's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself no matter what they say
Be yourself no matter what they say
Be yourself no matter what they say
Be yourself no matter what they say (oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien)
Be yourself no matter what they say (I'm an Englishman in New York)
Be yourself no matter what they say (oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien)
Be yourself no matter what they say (I'm an Englishman in New York)

Don't Look Back in Anger,Oasis,https://youtu.be/X59TlszGtfM?si=cIo-rVERYttAHpcn,"Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Will slowly fade away
So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
And so Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows
If it's night or day
But please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock and roll band
Who'll throw it all away
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
And so Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say
So Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say
So Sally can wait
She knows it's too late
As she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
Don't look back in anger
I heard you say
At least not today"
The Sound of Silence,Simon & Garfunkel,https://youtu.be/HZVkk_aQ0BI?si=s8YGHPL76XeZLVrJ,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
Then the sign said, ""The words on the prophets are written on the subway walls
In tenement halls""
And whispered in the sound of silence"
True Colors,Cyndi Lauper,https://youtu.be/LPn0KFlbqX8?si=g6JlUetcqSCGCTNL,"You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small
But I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow
Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy, can't remember
When I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there
And I'll see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let it show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there
And I'll see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let it show
Your true colors
True colors
True colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow"
When I dream,carol kidd,https://youtu.be/mrR6tqKVoIM?si=agJSWsvp-X_vomBt,"I could build a mansion that is higher than the trees
I could have all the gifts I want and never ask please
I could fly to Paris, it's at my beck and call
Why do I live my life alone with nothing at all?
But when I dream, I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true
When I dream, I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true
I can be the singer or the clown in any room
I can call up someone to take me to the moon
I can put my makeup on and drive the men insane
I can go to bed alone and never know his name
But when I dream, I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true
When I dream, I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true"
try to remember,The Brothers Four,https://youtu.be/SXlhBgMogwc?si=HxR8AZ_s5mGJrm30,"Try to remember the kind of September
When life was slow and oh, so mellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green and grain was yellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When you were a tender and callow fellow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow, follow
Try to remember when life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow
Try to remember the kind of September
When love was an ember about to billow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow, follow
Deep in December, it's nice to remember
Although you know the snow will follow
Deep in December, it's nice to remember
The fire of September that made us mellow
Deep in December, our hearts should remember
And follow, follow, follow"
casablanca,bertie higgins,https://youtu.be/Blx9lHMivQs?si=Y5AfrGJMog-JxAgm,"I fell in love with you watching Casablanca
Back row of the drive-in show in the flickering light
Popcorn and cokes beneath the stars
Became champagne and caviar
Making love on a long hot summer's night
I thought you fell in love with me watching Casablanca
Holding hands 'neath the paddle fans in Rick's candle lit caf√©
Hiding in the shadows from the spies
Moroccan moonlight in your eyes
Making magic at the movies in my old Chevrolet
Ooh, a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
But a kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
Please come back to me in Casablanca
I love you more and more each day as time goes by
I guess there are many broken hearts in Casablanca
You know I've never really been there, so I don't know
I guess our love story will never be seen
On the big wide silver screen
But it hurt just as bad when I had to watch you go
Ooh, a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
But a kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
Please come back to me in Casablanca
I love you more and more each day as time goes by
Ooh, a kiss is still a kiss in Casablanca
But a kiss is not a kiss without your sigh
Please come back to me in Casablanca
I love you more and more each day as time goes by
I love you more and more each day as time goes by"
alone again,gilbert o?ôsullivan,https://youtu.be/gU3ubk8u7dA?si=d8HPDEly-0-qoLlW,"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to
Make it clear to whoever
Wants to know what it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch at a church
Were people saying, My God, that's tough
She stood him up
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally
To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about, God in His mercy
Oh, if he really does exist
Why did he desert me
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally
It seems to me that
There are more hearts broken in the world
That can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do
What do we do
Alone again, naturally
Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start
With a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally"
"say you, say me",lionel richie,https://youtu.be/gIbw0OkC9po?si=1-vU_A6p6ZXherQR,"Say you, say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally
I had a dream, I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind the walls of doubt
A voice was crying out
Say you, say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally
As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
That helping hand
Someone who understands
That when you feel you've lost your way
You've got someone there to say, ""I'll show you""
Say you, say me
Say it for always (oh)
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally
So you think you know the answers? Oh no
Well the whole world's got you dancing
That's right, I'm telling you
Time to start believing, oh yes
Believe in who you are
You are a shining star
Say you, say me
Say it for always
Oh, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally
Say it together, naturally"

top of the world,the carpenters,https://youtu.be/vupwAFMXLkA?si=8u03SNHypIq_dMyC,"??Such a feelin's comin' over me
There is wonder in most every thing I see
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream
??Everything I want the world to be
Is now comin' true especially for me
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
??I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found, ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world
??Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees, and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me
??There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be, just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here
??I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found, ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world
??I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found, ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world"

My Heart Will Go On,Celine Dion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p79GmLNLMrY,"Every night in my dreams. I see you. I feel you.
That is how I know you go on.
Far across the distance. And spaces between us.
You have come to show you go on.
Near, far, wherever you are. I believe that the heart does go on.
Once more you open the door. And you're here in my heart.
And my heart will go on and on.
Love can touch us one time. And last for a lifetime.
And never go till we're one.
Love was when I loved you. One true time I hold you.
In my life we'll always go on.
Near, far, wherever you are. I believe that the heart does go on.
Once more you open the door. And you're here in my heart.
And my heart will go on and on.
You're here, there's nothing I fear.
And I know that my heart will go on.
We'll stay forever this way. You are safe in my heart.
And my heart will go on and on."

Bohemian Rhapsody,Queen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjpGNHPcTLA,"Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide No escape from reality.
Open your eyes.
Look up to the skies and see.
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy.
Because I'm easy come, easy go, A little high, little low, Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me.
Mama just killed a man.
Put a gun against his head.
Pulled my trigger now he's dead.
Mama, life had just begun.
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.
Mama, wooo. Didn't mean to make you cry - If I'm not back again this time tomorrow.
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.
Too late my time has come Sends shivers down my spine.
Body's aching all the time Goodbye everybody.
I've got to go - Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
Mama, wooo.
I don't want to die.
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
I see a little silhouette of a man.
Scaramouche scaramouche will you do the Fandango.
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me!
Galileo Galileo Galileo Galileo Galileo figaro! - Magnifico!
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me.
He's just a poor boy from a poor family.
Spare him his life from this monstrosity.
Easy come easy go.
Will you let me go - Bismillah! No - we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go Bismillah!
We will not let you go let me go Will not let you go -let me go Will not let you go.
Let me go No no no no no no no.
Mama mia mama mia mama mia let me go.
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me for me.
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye.
So you think you can love me and leave me to die.
Oh, baby. Can't do this to me baby.
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here.
Nothing really matters.
Anyone can see Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me."

Looking out for the place to go.
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing.
You come in for a king.
Anybody could be that guy.
Night is young and the music's high.
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine.
You're in the mood for a dance.
And when you get the chance.
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen.
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine.
Oh yeah, you can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life.
Ooooh, see that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen.
You're a tease, you tried them all.
Leave them burning and then you're gone.
Looking out for another, anyone will do.
You're in the mood for a dance.
And when you get the chance...

I Just Called to Say I Love You,Stevie Wonder,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II6-Bd7Vyk0,"No New Year's Day to celebrate. No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away.
No first of Spring, no song to sing. In fact here's just another ordinary day.
No April rain, no flowers bloom.
No wedding Saturday, within the month of June.
But what it is, is something true.
Made up of these three words that I must say to you.
I just called to say I love you. I just called to say how much I care.
I just called to say I love you.
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
No summer's high. No warm July.
No harvest moon to light one tender August night.
No autumn breeze. No falling leaves.
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies.
No Libra sun. No Halloween.
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring.
But what it is, though old so new.
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do.
I just called to say I love you. I just called to say how much I care.
I just called to say I love you.
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
I just called to say I love you. I just called to say how much I care.
I just called to say I love you.
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
Of my heart.
Of my heart."

Imagine there's no countries.
It isn't hard to do.
Nothing to kill or die for.
No religion too.
Imagine all the people living life in peace.
You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.
I hope some day you'll join us.
And the world will live as one.
Imagine no possessions I wonder if you can.
No need for greed or hunger.
A brotherhood of man. Imagine all the people Sharing all the world.
You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.
I hope some day you'll join us.
And the world will live as one."

On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame.
Turning and returning to some secret place inside.
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say.
Take my breath away.
Take my breath away.
Watching I keep waiting still anticipating love.
Never hesitating to become the fated ones.
Turning and returning to some secret place to hide.
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say.
My love take my breath away.
Through the hourglass I saw you in time you slipped away.
When the mirror crashed I called you.
And turned to hear you say.
If only for today I am unafraid.
Take my breath away.
Take my breath away.
Watching every motion in this foolish lover?ôs game.
Haunted by the motion somewhere there?ôs a love in flames.
Turning and returning to some secret place inside.
Watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say.
Take my breath away my love. Take my breath away."

Don't lose you grip on the dreams of the past.

It's the eye of tiger.
It's the thrill for the fight, risin' up to the challenge of our rival.
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night and he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger.
Face to face out in the heat.
Hanging tough staying hungry.
They stack the odds, still we take to the street.

She,Elvis Costello,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O040xuq2FR0,"She
May be the face I can't forget.
The trace of pleasure or regret.
May be my treasure or the price I have to pay.
She
May be the song that summer sings.
May be the chill that autumn brings.
May be a hundred different things.
Within the measure of a day.
She
May be the beauty or the beast.
May be the famine or the feast.
May turn each day into a heaven or a hell.
She may be the mirror of my dreams.
The smile reflected in a stream.
She may not be what she may seem.
Inside her shell.
She
Who always seems so happy in a crowd.
Whose eyes can be so private and so proud.
No one's allowed to see them when they cry.
She
May be the love that cannot hope to last.
May come to me from shadows of the past.
That I'll remember till the day I die.
She
May be the reason I survive.
The why and wherefore I'm alive.
The one I'll care for through the rough in ready years.
Me
I'll take her laughter and her tears.
And make them all my souvenirs.
For where she goes I've got to be.
The meaning of my life is
She

Are rolling like thunder now.
As I look in your eyes.
I hold on to your body.
And feel each move you make.
Your voice is warm and tender.
A love that I could not forsake.
'Cause I am your lady.
And you are my man.
Whenever you reach for me.
I'll do all that I can.
Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms.
When the world outside's too.
Much to take.
That all ends when I'm with you.
Even though there may be times.
It seems I'm far away.
Never wonder where I am.
'Cause I am always by your side.
We're heading for something.
Somewhere I've never been.
Sometimes I am frightened.
But I'm ready to learn.
Of the power of love.
The sound of your heart beating.
Made it clear.
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on.
Is light years away."

Indescribable feeling.
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling.
Through an endless diamond sky.
A whole new world.
Don't you dare close your eyes.
A hundred thousand things to see.
Hold your breath, it gets better.
I'm like a shooting star.
I've come so far.
I can't go back to where I used to be.
A whole new world.
Every turn, a surprise.
With new horizons to pursue.
Every moment, red-letter.
I'll chase them anywhere.
There's time to spare.
Let me share this whole new world with you.
A whole new world.
A whole new world.
That's where we'll be.
That's where we'll be.
A thrilling chase.
A wondrous place.
For you and me."
Somewhere Over the Rainbow,Judy Garland,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSZxmZmBfnU,"Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high.
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue.
And the dreams that you dare to dream.
Really do come true.
Someday I'll wish upon a star.
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
Away above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.
Somewhere, over the rainbow, bluebirds fly.
Birds fly over the rainbow, why then - oh, why can't I?
Someday I'll wish upon a star.
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
Away above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.
Somewhere, over the rainbow, bluebirds fly.
Birds fly over the rainbow,
Why then - oh, why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow.
Why, oh, why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow.
Why, oh, why can't I?"
Another one bites the dust,Queen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY0WxgSXdEE,"Oh, let's go.
Steve walks warily down the street.

Machine guns ready to go

Out of the doorway the bullets rip to the sound of the beat.
Another one bites the dust.
Another one bites the dust.
And another one gone, and another one gone.
Another one bites the dust.
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too.
Another one bites the dust.
How do you think I'm going to get along,
Without you when you're gone?
You took me for everything that I had.
And kicked me out on my own.
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip to the sound of the beat.
Another one bites the dust.
Another one bites the dust.

Oh shooter
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man.
And bring him to the ground.
You can beat him, you can cheat him.
You can treat him bad and leave him when he's down.
But I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you.
I'm standing on my own two feet.
Out of the doorway the bullets rip.
Repeating to the sound of the beat, oh yeah.
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Can You Feel the Love Tonight,Elton John,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjgWWjkNbhU,"There's calm surrender.
To the rush of day.
When the heat of the rolling wind.
Can be turned away.
An enchanted moment.
And it sees me through.
It's enough for this restless warrior.
Just to be with you.
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are.
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer.
That we got this far.
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest.
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds.
Believe the very best.
There's a time for everyone.
If they only learn.
That the twisting kaleidoscope.
Move us all in turn.
There's rhyme and reason.
To the wild out door.
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager.
Beats in time with yours.
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are.
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer.
That we got this far.
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest.
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds.
Believe the very best.
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds."

Raise your hopeful voice you have a choice.
You?ôve made it now.
Falling slowly, eyes that know me.
And I can?ôt go back.
Moods that take me and erase me.

You have suffered enough.
And warred with yourself.

I paid the cost too late.

We Are The World,USA for Africa,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3wNuru4U0I,"There comes a time when we heed a certain call.
When the world must come together as one.
There are people dying.
Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life.
The greatest gift of all we can't go on pretending day by day.
That someone, somehow will soon make a change.
We're all a part of God's great big family and the truth.
You know love is all we need.
We are the world, we are the children.
We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving.
There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives.
It's true we'll make a better day just you and me.
Well, send'em you your heart so they know that someone cares.
And their lives will be stronger and free.
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread.
And so we all must lend a helping hand.
We are the world, we are the children.
We are the ones who make a brighter day so let's start giving.
There's a choice we're making we're saving our own lives.
It's true we'll make a better day just you and me.
When you're down and out there seems no hope at all.
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall.
Well, well, well, let's realize that a change can only come.
When we stand together as one."

You make me happy when skies are gray.
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you.
Please don't take my sunshine away.
The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping.
I dreamed I held you in my arms.
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken.
So I hung my head and cried.
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine.
You make me happy when skies are gray.
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you.
Please don't take my sunshine away."
Hotel California,Eagles,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqPtz5qN7HM,"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself, ""This could be heaven or this could be hell""
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year)
You can find it here""
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes-Benz, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain, ""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still, those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""
Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
And she said, ""We are all just prisoners here of our own device""
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
""Relax, "" said the night man, ""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave"""

Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take
Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
I'll be watchin' you
Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep cryin', ""Baby, baby, please""
Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?

Billie Jean,Michael Jackson,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi_XLOBDo_Y,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (oh-oh), hey-ey
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (hoo)
She says I am the one (oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)
For forty days and for forty nights, law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice) do think twice (ah-hoo)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
Go and dance on the floor in the round, baby (ooh, hee-hee-hee)
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (don't break no hearts, hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room, hey-ey
Billie Jean is not my lover (hoo)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no, no-no-no (hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (no, no)
She says I am the one (oh, baby)

Hee, hoo
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son (no-no-no, hoo, oh)

She says I am the one (no)
But the kid is not my son (no-no-no-no)

Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry
Woah-woah-woah
Sweet child of mine
Woah oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
and the rain to quietly pass me by

I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcases of memories
Time after
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, go slow, I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting (I'll be waiting)
Time after time
After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
You said, go slow, I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting (I'll be waiting)

What is Love Got to Do with It,Tina Turner,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGpFcHTxjZs,"You must understand, though the touch of your hand makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl, opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that
Oh-oh-oh, what's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love, but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
It may seem to you that I'm acting confused when you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed, I read it some place, I got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason, you do it for me
Oh-oh-oh, what's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love, but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
Who?
I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way
Oh-oh-oh, what's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love, but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
got to do, got to do with it?

Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

Careless Whisper,George Michael,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izGwDsrQ1eQ,"Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
""""""""""
Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all that you'll find
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
""""""""""
Never without your love
""""""""""
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please, stay
And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Now, that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Was what I did so wrong
So wrong
That you had to leave me alone?"

Shyin' away

Take on me

Take me on
(Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
So needless to say
I'm odds and ends

Slowly learnin' that life is okay
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry
Take on me

Africa,Toto,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTQbiNvZqaY,"Hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's comin' in, 12:30 flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you""
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had, ooh-hoo
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had, ooh-hoo
Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you

I Want to Know What Love Is,Foreigner,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3Pr1_v7hsw,"I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
(Whoa, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
And this mountain, I must climb
Feels like the world upon my shoulders
And through the clouds, I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
Oh, oh-oh, oh (ooh)
I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

Wind of Change,Scorpions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4RjJKxsamQ,"I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
The world is closing in
And did you ever think?
That we could be so close?
Like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change
(Mmmmmmm)
Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
With you and me (you and me)

On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change (wind of change)
The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to sing (sing)
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)

Girl you know we belong together
I have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby, you just see
We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart?
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye
Well, I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go,
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Girl, I know you really love me,
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, hmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever, you and I
Can you love me again like you loved me before
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me down

Girl I'm here for you
All those times at night when you just hurt me
And just run out with that other fella
Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you do you
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat at night
Just like you did baby but that's all right
Huh, I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby
because you just won't come back to me
Will you, just come back to me
(Lonely)
Yes baby my heart is lonely
(Lonely)
My heart hurts baby

I feel pain too
Baby please
This time instead just come to my bed

Faith,George Michael,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Cs3Pvmmv0E,"Well, I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
I know not everybody has got a body like you
But I gotta think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play because I played them too
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door
'Cause I gotta' have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I got to have faith, faith, faith

Say, ""Please, please, please don't go away""
You say I'm givin' you the blues
Maybe (Huh) you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh, baby, I reconsider my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for somethin' more
Yes I gotta have faith
Ooh, I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I'll just have to wait
Because I've got to have faith

Sacrifice,Elton John,https://youtu.be/NrLkTZrPZA4?si=p9gNxO3h4QUisXNO,"It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes calling
And negativity lands
Cold cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better, baby
Just passing through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts living
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all
Mutual misunderstanding
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns
Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But, it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice, at all
Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But, it's no sacrifice

And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright

I can make all the stadiums rock
I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone
But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really wanna see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do

Nothing more to say

??The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny
??I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
??Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
??Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed
??The judges will decide (will decide)
The likes of me abide (me abide)
Spectators of the show (of the show)
Always staying low (staying low)

If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
??I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence

Throw the dice, cold as ice
Way down here, someone dear
Takes it all, has to fall

Wheels go round and round
You're on my mind

Sleep alone tonight
Sendin' all my love
Along the wire
They say that the road
Ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line
It's been you and me
And lovin' a music man
Ain't always what it's supposed to be
Oh girl you stand by me
I'm forever yours...faithfully
Circus life
Under the big top world
We all need the clowns
To make us smile
Through space and time
Always another show
Wondering where I am
Lost without you
And being apart ain't easy
On this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy
Of rediscovering you
Oh girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours...faithfully
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Faithfully, I'm still yours
I'm forever yours
Ever yours faithfully

Yeah woh
Hey yeah ah ooh yeah ah ha
Yeah I want to dance
Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
There's still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up till now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
Loneliness calls
Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh I wanna dance wiht somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
(Somebody ooh somebody ooh)
Somebody who loves me yeah
(Somebody ooh somebody ooh)
To hold me in his arms oh
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love tha bruns hot
Enough to last
So when the night falls

Arthur's Theme(Best That You Can Do),Christopher Cross,https://youtu.be/xWoGS5B9fvA?feature=shared,"Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way 'cross town
Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""
When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do
Is fall in love
Arthur, he does as he pleases
All of his life, his master's toys
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a pretty good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be
When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (The best that you can do)
The best that you can do
Is fall in love"

Just The Way You Are,Billy Joel,https://youtu.be/C5tXGwUCD1c?feature=shared,"Don't go changing to try and please me
You never let me down before, mmm
Don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore
I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far, mmm
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are
Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair, mmm
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care
I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard, mmm
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are
I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
Oh, but what will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you?
I said I love you, that's forever
And this I promise from the heart, mmm
I couldn't love you any better
I love you just the way you are, right
I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard, mmm

I want you just the way you are"
Sailing,Christopher Cross,https://youtu.be/AWDsENco3-8?feature=shared,"Well, it's not far down to paradise

And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find tranquility
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me
It's not far to never never land
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right you can find the joy
Of innocence again
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me
Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free
Fantasy
It gets the best of me
When I'm sailing
All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?
Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free
Well, it's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Can't you, believe me?

Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me

And I want to tell you so much....
I love you.
I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again, how much I care.
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow.
Hello!
I've just got to let you know
Cause I wonder where you are, and I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely, or is someone loving you!?.
Tell me how to win your heart, for I haven't got a clue.
But let me start by saying...
I love you.

Time in a Bottle,Jim Croce,https://youtu.be/g4NBS-Dcmsw?feature=shared,"If I could save time in a bottle

Is to save every day
'Til eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you
If I could make days last forever
If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
Again, I would spend them with you
But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do
Once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go
Through time with
If I had a box just for wishes
And dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty
Except for the memory
Of how they were answered by you
But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do
Once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go

Baby come back, listen baby, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you
I was wrong and I just can't live"
Open Arms,Journey,https://youtu.be/Cyr_-PMjDNU?feature=shared,"Lying beside you here in the dark
Feeling your heartbeat with mine
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind?
We sailed on together and drifted apart
And here you are, by my side
So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms
Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near
How much I wanted you home
But now that you've come back, turned night into day
I need you to stay
So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

"He  Ain't Heavy, He is My Brother",The Hollies,https://youtu.be/rz6XoHrMet0?feature=shared,"??The road is long
With many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where, who knows where
But I'm strong
Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
??So on we go
His welfare is of my concern
No burden is he to bear
We'll get there
??For I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
??If I'm laden at all
I'm laden with sadness
That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with the gladness
Of love for one another
??It's a long, long road
From which there is no return
While we're on the way to there
Why not share?
??And the load
Doesn't weigh me down at all
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
??He's my brother
He ain't heavy, he's my brother
He ain't heavy, he's my brother"
More Than Words,Extreme,https://youtu.be/6MO_-kP6rTg?feature=shared,"Saying ""I love you""
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say but if you only knew
How easy, it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know
What would you do
If my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say
If I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying ""I love you""
La-di-da, da-di-da
Di-dai-dai-da
More than words
La-di-da, da-di-da
Now that I've tried to
Talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me
Hold me close, don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know
What would you do
If my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say
If I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying ""I love you"""
Right Here Waiting,Richard Marx,https://youtu.be/-sMibx1b4uw?feature=shared,"Oceans apart, day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
If I see you next to never
But how can we say forever?
Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
I took for granted all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh, can't you see it, baby?
You've got me going crazy
Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end, if I'm with you
I'll take the chance
Oh, can't you see it, baby?
You've got me goin' crazy
Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
Waiting for you"
